# _TreeWatch_
> The [_TreeWatch_]() is an interactive map of Berlin that shows how thirsty the public trees of berlin are. More precisely, it visualizes the trees' ground suction tension. This suction tension represents the amount of energy tree roots are needing in order to suck out water from the ground. Using open data as well as sensors distributed under the ground of about a hundred trees, an AI developed by [Birds on Mars](https://www.birdsonmars.com/) is able to generate forecasts for the trees not equiped with sensors. This web-app is oriented towards the public and should inform about the AI-generated forecasts in a simple and intuitive way.

## Context
Climate change is causing increasingly hot, dry weather in many places. In recent years, Berlin has also experienced more hot days than ever before. Determining whether trees are in need of water isn't as easy as looking at the ground on the surface level. Many factors such as the tree's age, specie, plate size or ground quality play an important role. Old trees, for instance, tend to have deep roots and thereby be less dependent on additional watering. Overwatering can in fact be more detrimental to a tree than helpful.

This application is completely based on open data, much of which is administrative or weather data. Open data is now an important part of Berlin's administrative activities and not only creates transparency and openness, but also enables analysis and applications like this to make everyday life a little bit more pleasant. You can find more open data at the [Berlin Open Data Portal](https://daten.berlin.de/).

## Tech stack
This website is a NextJS app configured with:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- Formatting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- Linting, typechecking and formatting on by default using [`husky`](https://github.com/typicode/husky) for commit hooks
- Testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [`react-testing-library`](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)

## Getting started

### Requirements

#### Node.js

This project is a Next.js app which requires you to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

#### MapTiler

We use [MapTiler](https://maptiler.com/) for rendering the basemap in the background. You will need to put your MapTiler API key into the `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPTILER_KEY` environment variable. Make also sure to add whatever URL the app is run on to the list of allowed URLs in your MapTiler configuration.

Because we use a customized basemap hosted on MapTiler, you also need to provide the `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPTILER_BASEMAP_URL`.

Both variables can be found in our shared vault.

#### Trees vector tiles

We fetch the trees vector tileset from our self-hosted tileserver. Add the URL to that tileset to the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_TREE_TILES_URL`. Find the variable in our shared vault as well.

#### Trees API (using Supabase)

We use a small "passthrough" API which exposes all the data that is required. The API is deployed as a Supabase Edge Function. Make sure to include the necessary environment variables as specified in `.env.example`.

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:technologiestiftung/treewatch-frontend.git
```

Move into the repository folder:

```bash
cd treewatch-frontend
```

Make sure you use the Node.js version specified in `.nvmrc`. Find out which Node version you're currently on with:

```bash
node --version
```

If this version differs from the one specified in `.nvmrc`, please install the required version, either manually, or using a tool such as [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), which allows switching to the correct version via:

```bash
nvm use
```

With the correct Node version, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Because we use Supabase for accessing the database, you will need to provide connection details in your environment. In this repository you can find a file `.env.example`. Duplicate this file and name it `.env`.

In `.env` you must enter the connection details for Supabase as suggested in `.env.example`. If you do not know how to obtain the necessary details, please ask a repository maintainer for access.

You are now ready to start a local development server on http://localhost:3000 via:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment
_TreeWatch_ is deployed to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).

## Page analytics

We use [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) for website analytics. Matomo is respectful of the users' privacy, the page visits are tracked anonymously.

In the production environment, a `NEXT_PUBLIC_MATOMO_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_MATOMO_SITE_ID` is configured for this purpose.
